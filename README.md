 Do you want to know who I am? Read this. |  Who is Reza Dadfar ?


## Introduction : 
First of all, let me say that this is my first text, and it might have some issues. I apologize in advance!

#### Today (16th of July, 2024), I want to talk to you about the following topics:

- Who I am 
- My birth year 
- What is my profession 
- What I do
- My overall goal 
- and like that ... 

## who I am 
I think it's better for you to get to know me through my story, although I don't think I have an interesting story :))
Well, first I should say that as evident from my profile name, my name is Reza Dadfar, and currently, I live in Iran (the location isn't important; it's where the heart is :) ) . 
My story begins when I was about 12 years old and became interested in anything related to technology during my school days. My classmates also encouraged me to some extent (actually, they saw my potential and always requested help, not financial support, XD) Anyway, since those days, I've been very keen on learning about this world (programming, editing, etc.), and I've been somewhat successful. During that time, I also delved into photo and video editing, and perhaps dabbled a bit in creating some software (without misusing it) By the time I turned 15, I didn't have a computer or laptop to pursue more professional work, so I made a concerted effort to get a laptop. I asked my father tirelessly to get me one so I could learn with it, and finally, at the age of 16, I managed to get one after much struggle.

**The crucial part** is that after buying the laptop, I started learning Java programming to work on Android. After going through various wrong paths, I eventually became somewhat proficient. However, due to not having a team, I couldn't properly launch my app online. So, I decided to move towards backend development.


Since I already knew another language (Java), it wasn't difficult for me to pick up JavaScript. So, before starting with JavaScript, I decided to learn frontend development for better understanding and because I was inclined towards it. I began learning HTML and CSS, then moved on to JavaScript. Afterwards, I learned JavaScript and eventually moved towards backend development with Node.js. Due to my interest and PHP's popularity, I also ventured into PHP to some extent (though not as quickly as before, since I had already completed several cool projects by then).

**And this is a general path I followed to reach where I am now. You can see my current age and skills, or rather the things I have learned and mastered, in the skills section.**

## My birth year 
I was born on 8-15-1382 in the Persian calendar (equal to November 6, 2003 in the lunar calendar), which means that I am almost 20 years and 8 months old as I am writing this now. :) 

## What is my profession 
#### the best part , My professions and skills : 
- **Html & Css**
- **BootStrap**
- **JavaScript**
- **Node.js**
- **PHP**
- **A bit of WordPress**
- **A bit of SEO**
- **Image Editor**
- **Video Editor**

## What I do
Currently, I'm a student and also trying to freelance on the side. I'm passionate about learning and exploring new professions, aiming to make the most of my life. My focus is mainly on programming, university studies, and a few other commitments, though unfortunately, I don't have much time for leisure activities.

## My overall goal 
My ultimate goal is to enjoy life and learn. I see learning as an integral part of enjoying life, and achieving these goals requires sacrificing certain other things. Like everyone else, I have material desires such as a home and a car, which are tools for stability and furthering my goals, not the goals themselves.

**In conclusion, I reiterate that my entire purpose revolves around enjoying life and learning.**
